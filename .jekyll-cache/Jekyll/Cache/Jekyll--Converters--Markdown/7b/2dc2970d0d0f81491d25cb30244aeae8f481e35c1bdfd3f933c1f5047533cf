I"Ö<p>Hereâ€™s a repository of various graphs Iâ€™ve made over the years. Most of these are for my intro to IR class but there are a few graphs here Iâ€™ve made for other purposes. I place these here as a means of disseminating information about various things in the world for a more general audience.</p>

<p>And yes, as soon as I can figure out more of <a href="https://jekyllrb.com/">Jekyll</a> to make this page useful, Iâ€™ll do it.</p>
